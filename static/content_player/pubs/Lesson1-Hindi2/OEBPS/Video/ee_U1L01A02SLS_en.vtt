<b>Chotapur! Chotapur!</b>

2
00:00:13.177 --> 00:00:13.840
<b>Hey boy,</b>

3
00:00:14.066 --> 00:00:17.368
<b>your father said that you have
to get down at this stop.</b>

4
00:00:17.701 --> 00:00:18.629
<b>Oh, okay.</b>

5
00:00:18.941 --> 00:00:21.705
<b>I'll get my bags and get down here.</b>

6
00:00:22.165 --> 00:00:24.437
<b>Thank you, conductor.
Bye.</b>

7
00:00:29.545 --> 00:00:30.615
<b>Owww!</b>

8
00:00:31.068 --> 00:00:32.675
<b>Can’t you see where
you're going?</b>

9
00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.572
<b>You didn't see where
you were going!</b>

10
00:00:34.822 --> 00:00:37.070
<b>Look at what you've
done to my cycle!</b>

11
00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.664
<b>The handle bar is all bent.</b>

12
00:00:39.856 --> 00:00:41.885
<b>Look at what you've done to me!</b>

13
00:00:42.103 --> 00:00:44.406
<b>My elbows are all bruised.</b>

14
00:00:46.747 --> 00:00:48.339
<b>Kanasu, are you okay?</b>

15
00:00:48.364 --> 00:00:49.472
<b>I’m not hurt.</b>

16
00:00:49.791 --> 00:00:50.931
<b>Who's this boy?</b>

17
00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:53.085
<b>And you?
Are you fine?</b>

18
00:00:53.133 --> 00:00:56.343
<b>I’m fine.
 These are just scratches on my elbow.</b>

19
00:00:56.419 --> 00:00:58.938
<b>Kanasu, this was your fault.</b>

20
00:00:59.142 --> 00:01:02.174
<b>Don’t shout at him for something
you know you have done.</b>

21
00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:02.861
<b>But!</b>

22
00:01:03.068 --> 00:01:04.230
<b>Okay. Fine.</b>

23
00:01:04.572 --> 00:01:06.805
<b>Yes, it was my fault.</b>

24
00:01:07.055 --> 00:01:08.967
<b>I’m sorry.
That’s okay.</b>

25
00:01:09.123 --> 00:01:11.675
<b>Hi, my name is Sahir.</b>

26
00:01:12.066 --> 00:01:14.220
<b>I don't think we have met before.</b>

27
00:01:14.617 --> 00:01:17.552
<b>Are you visiting someone
here in Chotapur?</b>

28
00:01:17.896 --> 00:01:19.470
<b>Hi, I'm Zo.</b>

29
00:01:19.581 --> 00:01:21.353
<b>I have come from Badapur.</b>

30
00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:24.155
<b>I'm waiting for my
grandmother to pick me up.</b>

31
00:01:24.304 --> 00:01:26.598
<b>Hello, Zo.
I'm Kanasu.</b>

32
00:01:26.895 --> 00:01:30.414
<b>I've heard so much about Badapur.
Did you go to school there?</b>

33
00:01:30.593 --> 00:01:33.700
<b>Which class are you in?
Tell me more about Badapur.</b>

34
00:01:35.323 --> 00:01:38.617
<b>Oh! I can see Aunty
coming towards us!</b>

35
00:01:38.711 --> 00:01:41.567
<b>Hi Aunty!
That’s my Grandma!</b>

36
00:01:41.973 --> 00:01:44.821
<b>Hi, Zo!
I’m sorry I'm late.</b>

37
00:01:45.016 --> 00:01:49.380
<b>I’m getting older by the day and
my knees are getting weaker.</b>

38
00:01:49.848 --> 00:01:53.695
<b>You have grown at least 2 inches
since I last saw you!</b>

39
00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:56.646
<b>What happened to your elbows?!</b>

40
00:01:57.785 --> 00:02:00.899
<b>I had a small fall but I'm fine.</b>

41
00:02:01.133 --> 00:02:05.582
<b>Unfortunately, the handlebar
of Kanasu’s cycle is bent.</b>

42
00:02:05.606 --> 00:02:09.328
<b>I see that you've already
met Kanasu and Sahir.</b>

43
00:02:09.711 --> 00:02:13.024
<b>Zo can help you
fix your cycle, Kanasu.</b>

44
00:02:13.321 --> 00:02:16.485
<b>He's really good with
repairing things.</b>

45
00:02:16.735 --> 00:02:19.723
<b>Why don't you both
join us for a cup of tea?</b>

46
00:02:19.776 --> 00:02:20.988
<b>Sure, Aunty.</b>

47
00:02:21.267 --> 00:02:22.993
<b>That’s a good idea.</b>

48
00:02:23.103 --> 00:02:25.899
<b>Come, Zo, let me help
you carry that bag.</b>

49
00:02:26.211 --> 00:02:30.314
<b>Kanasu, you can walk with the cycle.
No thanks Sahir.</b>

50
00:02:30.549 --> 00:02:32.549
<b>It is alright.
 It is not heavy.</b>

51
00:02:32.634 --> 00:02:35.548
<b>You can put the other
bag on the cycle, Zo.</b>

52
00:02:35.931 --> 00:02:36.923
<b>Let’s go!</b>
